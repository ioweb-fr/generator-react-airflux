# React-Airflux generator for Yeoman

## Description

This generator creates a project that includes React, Airflux 
(an ES6 Flux implementation) and Simod (our microlibrary for 
models management).

It defines a Webpack compilation process triggered by Gulp and it 
enables code hot swapping.

## Usage

### Creating a new project

```$> yo react-airflux```

```%> gulp```

### Creating a view in an existing project

```$> yo react-airflux:view my-view```

### Creating a store in an existing project

```$> yo react-airflux:store my-store```

### Creating a model in an existing project

```$> yo react-airflux:model my-model```
